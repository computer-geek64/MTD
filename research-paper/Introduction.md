# Introduction
*Deep Learning for Tropospheric Ozone Predictions*

**The average reading speed is 200 words per minute.**<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>
Reading is a skill that most people take for granted; it is a
highly complex process. Yet after billions of years of
evolution and intensive learning, one reads as simply as one
would take a breath of air. Advancing technologies in
artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened doors
for computers to learn by themselves, granting abilities even
as complex as reading. Tropospheric ozone is a hazardous
pollutant that harms life and degrades materials. With these
new technologies in machine learning, tropospheric ozone can
be forecasted. **Deep learning neural networks can accurately
predict tropospheric ozone.**<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>
