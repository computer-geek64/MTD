### Title: Deep Learning for Tropospheric Ozone Predictions

1. Introduction
    1. Hook: "The average reading speed is 200 words per minute. Reading is a
    skill that most people take for granted; it is a highly complex process.
    Yet after billions of years of evolution and intensive teaching, one reads
    as simply as one would take a breath of air. Advancing technologies in
    artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened up doors for
    computers to learn for themselves, including teaching themselves how to read
    through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning."
    1. Thesis: **"Deep learning neural networks can accurately predict
    tropospheric ozone."**
